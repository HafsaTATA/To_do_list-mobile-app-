For this projet , u need to fetch the Expo CLI package from the npm registry and install it globally on your system.
//Expo CLI is a command-line tool for developing and managing Expo projects, which are used for building React Native apps.

- Use npx expo to create a new project:
npx expo init todoList
(choose a blank template)
- Run the Expo project:
cd todoList
npx expo start


Why Create an Expo Project?
=> When you create an Expo project using expo init, it sets up a standard project structure with all the necessary folders and files. This includes configuration files, directories for your source code, assets, and more.

**it is possible to build a React Native app without using Expo. However, using Expo offers several benefits, especially at that beginner level, i'm looking for a streamlined setup**

Expo simplifies the setup process with tools and configurations already in place. You can start a project quickly without worrying about native code configurations.

To start the Expo Android SDK emulator
